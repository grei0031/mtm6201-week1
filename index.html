         <p> With a passion for media design and photography, I am currently working towards a diploma in Interactive Media Design from Algonquin College. Growing up, I was interested in digital mediums and would try to teach myself how to make videos and create digital art with the limited resources I had. 
         </p>

         <p> When I was in highschool, I took a media design program that reintroduced me to design as a young adult. This class inspired me to continue learning about media design in my college education. Learning further about the design industry has been very interesting to me. I have always focused on doing clean, clear work. Through researching my methods and going over every detail as many times as possible, everything I do I put as much effort into it that I can.
